# Java Custom Data Structures Project

## 📌 Description

This Java project implements several fundamental **data structures from scratch** without using the standard `java.util.*` classes (except `Iterator` as allowed). The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of data structures by building them manually.

### Implemented Structures:

- ✅ `MyArrayList<T>` – a custom implementation of a dynamic array
- ✅ `MyLinkedList<T>` – a doubly linked list
- ✅ `MyStack<T>` – a stack based on `MyArrayList`
- ✅ `MyQueue<T>` – a queue based on `MyLinkedList`
- ✅ `MyMinHeap<T>` – a min-heap based on `MyArrayList`

Each class is **generic** and provides basic operations like `add`, `remove`, `get`, `size`, etc.
